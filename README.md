# Stress-Detection

This project uses basic Linear Regression to relate the Stress Rate(0-4) of a person according to his/her snoring range, 
respiration rate, body temperature, limb movement rate, blood oxygen levels, eye movement, number of hours of sleep, heart rate.
I found thid dataset on Kaggle and I just had to work on it.
