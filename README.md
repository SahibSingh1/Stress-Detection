# Stress-Detection

This project aims to use basic Multinomial Logistic Regression to investigate the relationship between a person's stress rate and various factors such as their snoring range, respiration rate, body temperature, limb movement rate, blood oxygen levels, eye movement, number of hours of sleep, and heart rate. The dataset used in the project was obtained from Kaggle.
